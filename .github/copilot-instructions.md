# Copilot Instructions for AI Coding Agents

## Project Overview
- This project currently contains a `.qodo` directory, which is typically used for agent or workflow configuration in AI-driven or automation projects.
- The `.qodo/agents` and `.qodo/workflows` directories are present but currently empty. No agents or workflows are defined yet.

## Key Conventions
- No `README.md`, agent rules, or prior AI instructions were found in the codebase.
- No source code or configuration files (besides `.qodo/`) are present at this time.

## Guidance for AI Agents
- If you are tasked with initializing this project, follow any organization-specific standards for agent and workflow definitions.
- Place new agent definitions in `.qodo/agents/` and workflow definitions in `.qodo/workflows/`.
- If you add new files, document their purpose and structure in a future `README.md`.
- If you discover new conventions or patterns as the project evolves, update this file to reflect them.

## Next Steps
- As the project grows, update this file to document:
  - Major components and their responsibilities
  - Build, test, and deployment workflows
  - Project-specific patterns or integration points
  - Any non-obvious conventions or architectural decisions
